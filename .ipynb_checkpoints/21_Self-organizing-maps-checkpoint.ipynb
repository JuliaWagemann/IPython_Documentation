      "**Description:** Self-organizing maps (SOM) is a relatively new method in synoptic climatology. It is an unsupervised Neural Network methodology, which reduces large, multivariate datasets onto a 2-dimensional array. It is widely used as a data mining and visualization method for complex data sets. SOM applications becoming increasingly useful in geosciences, because it has been demonstrated to be an effective feature extraction techniques that has many advantages over conventional data analysis methods. It is a useful tool in meteorological applications of different spatial and temporal scales: synoptic climatology, extreme weather & rainfall pattern analysis, cloud classification, as well as climate change analysis.\n",

      "**Statistical method:** Unsupervised neural-network approach, based on competitve learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Methodological approach:**  \n",
      "it is based on machine learning: meaning, that the final SOM map evolves, or learns, from the input data.\n",
      "<br>\n",
      "\n",
      "* **1. Definition of a random distribution of nodes within the data space.**   \n",
      "The nodes are defined by a reference vector of weighting coefficients, where each coefficient is associated with a particular input variable. Each node has an associated reference vector equal in dimension to the input data.  \n",
      "<br>\n",
      "* **2. Presentation of each data record to randomaly initialized SOM.**  \n",
      "If the data record is presented to the SOM, the similarity between the data record and each node reference vector is calculated based on Euclidian distance.  \n",
      "<br>\n",
      "\n",
      "* **3. Identification of *Best-matching-unit (BMU)* **  \n",
      "*Best-matching-unit* or *winning node* is the node where the Euclidian distance between this node and the input data record is minimum. The BMU is then adjusted/modified by a user-defined learning rate. The difference of the BMU to the input data vector is reduced by this factor. The user-defined learning rate controls how fast the adjustment occurs. A small value  leads to a slow and smooth learning rate and a high value value to a fast but unstable learning process, respectively.  \n",
      "<br>\n",
      "* **4. Updating of neighbouring nodes**  \n",
      "After the BMU has been adjusted by the learning rate, the neighbouring units of the BMU are also updated to getting closer to the input data vector. The number of neighbouring units is specified by the radius of the training area. The amount of adjustment varies in inverse proportion to the distance of the BMU and in proportion to the learning rate parameter. This means that each input data record contributes to the characterisation of more than one node. With each iteration, the neighbourhood radius decreases and thus, the number of neighbouring nodes updated decreases. At the last iteration, solely the BMU is updated.  \n",
      "<br>\n",
      "* **5. Final SOM map**  \n",
      "Due to the update process, the nodes of the final SOM product are ordered. It means that nodes close together represent similar patterns.  \n",
