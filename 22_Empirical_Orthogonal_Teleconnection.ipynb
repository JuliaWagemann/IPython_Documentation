      "**Description:** The EOT analysis was introduced by [Van den Dool et al.](http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/people/wd51hd/vddoolpubs/vandendooletal_2000EOT.pdf) in 2001. EOT is a stepwise linear regression, where the predictands and predictors are discrete space-time (s,t) datasets T(s,t). At a first step, the point in space, that has the greatest variance to all other points in space combined, is identified. This point is called base point (sb) and the first spatial pattern is basically the regression coefficient between the base point and all other points. The explained portion of T(sb,t) is then removed from T(s,t) by standard regression. The next most important point in space is then searched based on the reduced dataset. The method can also be reversed, to have a base point in time rather than in space. The method is similar to teleconnection maps or EOFs, though feature certain advantages compared to common methods.\n",

      "**Statistical method:** Multivariate statistical method, stepwise linear regression\n",
      "\n",
      "**Methodological approach:** \n",
      "\n",
      "* **1. Find point in the space that explains most of the variance of all other points**  \n",
      "By brute force, based on a simple linear regression, the point (sb) that explains as much as possible of the variance of all other points. The first EOT is connected to sb. The space pattern of the first mode is the regression coefficient between the space-time dataset (T) at sb and T at all other points. The time series of the first EOT mode is the time series of the original data at point sb.  \n",
      "\n",
      "* **2. Split original space-time dataset into an \"explained\" and a \"reduced\" part**  \n",
      "Once the first EOT mode was identified, the original dataset is split into two parts: an explained and a reduced part. The explained part that is known because of the identification of the first EOT mode is subtracted from the original data set. The resulting reduced data set  is used to identify the second EOT mode. This procudure is repeated as many times as EOT modes were specified.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Advantages:** \n",
      "\n",
      "* EOTs are orthonoal either in space or time\n",
      "\n",
      "* Often reveals less pronounced spatial patterns\n",
      "\n",
      "* Linkage of modes (spatial patterns) of another parameter (e.g. precipitation) to specific base points of a driver variable (e.g. SST)\n",
      "\n",
      "    * Here also lag times can be introduced\n",
      "\n",
      "**Disadvantages:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The regression-based mode of EOT's is only linear, this means that only two variables can be analysed together \n",

      "Following Figure shows the first two EOT modes that were identified by analysing global Sea Surface Temperature from 1990-2011. The first mode clearly identifies the ENSO signal. The second one shows the Atlantic multi-decadal oscillation (AMO). The ENSO signal is not surprising, as it is definately the dominant pattern of interannual variability of global sea surface temperature. The AMO is a pattern of exceptionally strong warming at the Labrador sea and off the coast of Brazil.\n",

      "Low frequency signal of global oceans may influence global precipitation patterns. One of the most prominent low-frequency variability of SST is the ENSO signal. This analysis aimed at investigating the most important drivers of global SST for global precipitation patterns. It was further investigated if the ENSO signal can be extracted as a driver for global low-frequency precipitation variability. In the first case, if SST and precipitation anomalies are exposed without any time lag, the ENSO signal in the El Nino 3.4 region can be clearly extracted. ENSO as low frequency signal may cause precipitation shortages in Indonesia and northeast Brazil. On the other hand heavy rainfalls in East Africa, mainly Kenya, as well as in southern Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina will be expected. In general, the ENSO signal is responsible for **9% of global precipitation variability**. This does not sound a lot in the first case though it is to be kept in mind that precipitation is a highly variable climate parameter that is influenced by many different parameters. It is quite astonishing that solely the ENSO signal is responsible for **9 %** of its variation.\n",

At the first sight, again the ENSO pattern appears. However, analysing the appropriate time series it is striking that an anomaly of the signal appeared between 2010 and 2011. 2010/2011 is known as a very strong La Nina year. The extracted SST anomaly pattern strongly influencing global precipitation anomalies with a lag time of five month may be La Nina. Heavy rainfalls in south-east Asia, north-eastern Brazil and Colombia as well as eastern Australia result. Drier than normal periods are expected in equatorial Africa and in Uruguay, Peru and Argentina. \n",
